# React ES6 Starter Kit

Project to get started with React:
* webpack and webpack-dev-server
* ES6 and JSX via Babel 
* hot module reloading via [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)

Uses:
* `git clone https://github.com/manishkumarmdb/react-es6-starter`
* `cd react-es6-starter`
* `npm install`
* `npm run`

Development:
* Run dev server: `npm start`
    * Open browser and goto `http://localhost:8080/`
    * Open console to see errors and warnings

You can check out hot reloading by making changes to the JavaScript source code. Youâ€™ll see the results of those changes on the browser right away.
